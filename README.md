# DataScienceFinancialProject

The Data science Financial project goal is to identify buying opportunities based on Michael Burry Investment strategy which inspired the film "The Big Short". Firstly, we will establish a collect of all available data from companies with tickers. Then stock the data collected in an Sql database to move on and display informations on a remote server dashboard. Finally, we will make statistics on the retrieving data and deploy models to identify buying opportunities.
