# DataScienceFinancialProject

The Data science Financial project goal is to identify buying opportunities based on Michael Burry Investment strategy which inspired the film "The Big Short". Firstly, we will establish a collect of all available data from companies with tickers. Then stock the data collected in an Sql database to move on and display informations on a remote server dashboard. Finally, we will make statistics on the retrieving data and deploy models to identify buying opportunities.

(I can't put the end of the project (Data vizualisation, statistics analysis and ML part with skilit) because it belongs to the company i worked for. So i've just posted some scripts I kept which were not really important and allow me to show my skills)
